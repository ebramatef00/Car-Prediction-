# Car Price Prediction

## Overview
The **Car Price Prediction** project aims to develop a model for estimating car prices based on various features such as brand, model, manufacturing year, and more.

## Data
We use the `cars_data.csv` file, which contains detailed data for several cars.

## Model
The model is built using a Jupyter Notebook (`car_prediction.ipynb`). It includes data analysis, cleaning, and the application of machine learning algorithms.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ebraamatef00/car-price-prediction.git
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to see the steps taken to build, train, and test the model.
